# Keyboard-and-Mouse-Controller
This program illustrates the use of the Mouse and Keyboard libraries together. Five momentary switches act as directional buttons for your cursor. When a button is pressed, the cursor on your screen will move, and a keypress, corresponding to the letter associated with the direction, will be sent to the computer. Once we have the Leonardo programmed and wired up, open up the Arduino IDE and See the Magic.


# Hardware Required
*Arduino Leonardo, Micro or Arduino Due board

*5 pushbuttons

*5 10k ohm resistors

*hook-up wires

*breadboard

# Software Required

Arduino IDE

# Circuit

Attach one end of the the pushbuttons to pins 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 on the board. Attach the other end to +5V. Use the resistors as pull-downs, providing a reference to ground for the switches. Attach them from the pin connecting to the board to ground.

Once you've programmed your board, unplug the USB cable and open a text editor. Connect your board to your computer and press the buttons to write in the document as you move the cursor.
